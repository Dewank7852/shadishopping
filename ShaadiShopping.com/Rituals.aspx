                        Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                    The wedding rituals begin with Panda Kaal Muhurtham, wherein the families of the
                    bride and the groom pray to the Lord for an uninterrupted wedding ceremony. After
                    this, the groom is welcomed with the traditional aarti by the bride's side on the
                    day before marriage. He is offered sweets, sprinkled with rose water and even a
                    coconut is broken to ward off any evil. Next is Vratham, which is a small puja organized
                    before marriage. Following this is Pallikai Thellichal ceremony, as per which grains
                    are sprouted in earthen pots, which are later immersed in a pond to feed the fishes.<br />
                    The next ritual is Naandi, in which Brahmins are given gifts and sweets to seek
                    their blessings for the wedding alliance. Nicchiyadharatham is the formal engagement
                    ceremony, wherein the bride and the groom exchange rings. After this, the Reading
                    of Lagna Pathirigai takes place, which is formally announcing the wedding and reading
                    out aloud the wedding invitation, to inform everybody about the formalizing of the
                    alliance.<br />
                    <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                    On the day of the wedding, Mangala Snaanam takes place, as per which the bride and
                    the groom take purifying bath. Before the bath, oil and haldi-kumkum are applied
                    to them. Another interesting ritual is Kashi Yatra, wherein the groom threatens
                    everyone to leave for Kashi and lead a life of ascetic. He is stopped by the bride's
                    father, who promises to give his daughter to her. After this, the groom heads towards
                    the mandap, where he meets the bride.<br />
                    Then the exchange of garlands takes place between the bride and the groom. This
                    is followed by the Oonjal ritual, wherein the couple is seated on a swing and given
                    milk and banana to eat. Rice balls are used to prevent them from evil eye. This
                    is followed by Kanyadaanam, in which the bride's father gives away his daughter
                    to the groom. After this, Muhurtum ritual takes place wherein the groom ties mangalsutra
                    and puts vermillion to the bride. Subsequently, they take seven rounds and seven
                    vows around the sacred fire called Saptapadi.<br />
                    <b>Post Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                    After the wedding, both the families exchange gifts with each other. This is called
                    Sammandhi Mariyathai. After all the wedding ceremonies are over, the bride leaves
                    with her husband for her marital home. Here, she is welcomed by her new family with
                    the traditional aarti. </span>

                        on the sacredness of the wedding. Following this, he asks question to the bride
                        and the groom regarding their consent for the marriage.&nbsp;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; The couple makes promises to stay with each other through thick and
                        thin and exchange rings. These rings are blessed by the priest first, to instill
                        love and faith between the two. After this the couple is blessed by the gathering
                        and the priest. The wedding concludes by signing on a register and the couple walks
                        down the aisle, arm in arm. A copy of the signed page is later sent to the Registrar
                        of Marriages.

                <b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pre Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                The pre wedding rituals comprise of engagement, tilak, sagai, sangeet and mehandi.
                The Engagement can also be called the ring ceremony, wherein the prospective couple
                exchanges rings. Next is the Tilak ceremony, in which the bride's brother applies
                tilak to the groom and gives him gifts. After this, the Sagai ceremony is conducted
                in which both the parties exchange gifts. Then comes the Sangeet ceremony, wherein
                the female members sing and dance to rejoice the occasion. Just before the wedding,
                the Mehandi ceremony is organized, in which mehndi is applied on bride's hands and
                feet.<br />
                <b>&nbsp; &nbsp; Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                The wedding rituals begin with the Jaimala ceremony, in which the bride and the
                groom exchange flower garlands. After this, they are taken to the mandap where the
                Kanyadaan ritual is performed. In this ritual, the bride's father gives away his
                daughter to the groom, while the priest chants mantras. After this, the Mangalpheras
                take place around the sacred fire. They also take the seven vows called Saptapadi,
                and promise to abide by them throughout their lives. After this, the groom puts
                sindoor or vermillion in the bride's hair parting. This is followed by tying of
                mangalsutra around the bride's neck by the groom.
                <br />
                <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Post Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                The post wedding rituals comprise of vidaai and reception. In the Vidaai ceremony
                the family of the bride gives her a sobbing farewell. Before leaving, the bride
                throws back three handful of rice and coin over her shoulders, towards her parental
                home. This is done to ensure wealth and prosperity remains in her home forever.
                On the arrival at the groom's house, the new couple is welcomed by the groom's mother,
                with a traditional aarti.&nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp;The bride is asked to knock a vessel filled with rice, kept at the entrance.
                She then dips her feet in a mixture of red vermillion and enters the house, leaving
                foot prints on the floor. This ritual is practiced as the bride is considered a
                form of Goddess Laxmi. After this, a number of wedding games are played to make
                the bride comfortable. Furthermore, a reception party is organized by the groom's
                family in the evening. This is organized to welcome the new member and introduce
                her to the associates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                The first ritual is the Roka ceremony which is conducted to secure the commitment
                from both the parties. It is a small function which basically involves exchange
                of sweets, gifts, dry fruits etc. The next ritual is Sagan which is either held
                at the groom's house or in banquet hall. The father of the bride applies tilak on
                the groom's forehead and offers him gifts and sweets. This is followed by Chunni
                Chadana, wherein the groom's family visits the bride's house. The groom's sister
                or sister-in-law presents the girl with a sari. After this, the mother-in-law places
                a red chunni on her head and gives her jewelry.
                <br />
                After this, the bride is fed boiled rice and milk by the groom's family and the
                couple exchanges rings. Few days before marriage, the Sangeet ceremony takes place,
                in which the female members of the family sing and dance to celebrate the occasion.
                Just before marriage, Mehandi ceremony takes place. In this, the sister and brother-in-law
                of the groom take mehndi to bride's place. This mehandi is applied to the bride's
                hands and feet. </span>

                Before the wedding, the bride is given red and white bangles to wear by her maternal

                bathe with the water brought from the Gurudwara. On the main wedding day, a flower
                veil is tied on the groom's forehead, after which he sits on the horse. These are

                the groom's house, the mother of the boy puts mustard oil on both the sides of the
                entrance door. Then she performs the traditional aarti and asks the newly wed couple
                to come inside and seek the blessings of the God. After this, a grand Reception

                <b>Pre Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                The engagement ceremony is the first ritual, which is performed at the groom's house.
                Only the male members of the bride's family visit the groom's place for the ceremony.
                The bride's brother applies tilak on the groom's forehead and gives him gifts. After
                this the Ganapati Sthapna &amp; Griha Shanti ceremony is held, wherein the bride
                and the groom's family perform havan and install the idol of Lord Ganesha. The next
                is the Pithi Dastoor, in which the bride and the groom are applied turmeric paste.
                <br />
                Mehfils form an integral part of the wedding celebrations. Both men and women have
                their own mehfils, wherein they sing and dance. This is followed by Mahira Dastoor
                custom, as per which the maternal uncles of the bride and the groom distributes
                gifts in the house. Other important ritual is Janev, in which the groom is made
                to wear a white thread. The groom pretends to run away from the marital bounds while
                his maternal uncle tries to convince him. Subsequently, the Palla Dastoor is conducted,
                wherein the bride worships Goddess Gauri.<br />
                <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                On the wedding day, the Rajput Baraat visits the bride's house. It is a regal procession,
                which does not involve any dancing. On his arrival he is welcomed by his mother-in-law,
                with the traditional aarti. He then proceeds towards the mandap. Here, mostly the
                women of the bride's family are present as themale members are entertaining the
                baraat. During the complete ceremony the bride covers her face with a long veil.
                From the groom's side, only one male member accompanies him.<br />
                <b>Post Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                After the wedding, the bride and the groom leave for their marital home. A coconut
                is placed under the wheel of the car, as the bride unveils herself in front of her
                husband. Usually at this point of time, the groom gifts her a piece of jewelry.
                On arrival at the groom's house, his family welcomes the newly wed couple. </span>

                The first wedding ritual is the Istikhara, wherein the religious head takes consent
                form Allah to perform the wedding. After it is done, the grrom's mather visits the
                bride's house with sweets and Imam-Zamin, a silver or gold coin wrapped in silken
                cloth. It is tied by her onto the upper portion of the girl's hand. This is called
                Imam-Zamin ceremony. The next is Magni, wherein the groom's family members visit
                the brie's house with sweets and fruits. This is reciprocated by the bride's family
                as well. Nowadays, the couple even exchanges rings.<br />
                After this the Manjha ceremony takes place, in which the bride is dressed in yellow
                clothes and turmeric paste is applied on her body. After this, the bride is not
                supposed to step out of the house. Mehndi Ceremony is the next ceremony, which is
                held just before the marriage. </span>

                On the main wedding day, the Baraat leaves for the bride's house. On the wedding
                venue, they are given a hearty welcome and the groom enjoys a glass of sherbet with
                his brother-in-law. Soon after this, the Nikah is commenced. There are two religious
                heads present at the place, representing the two parties. The amount of Mehar, a
                compulsory amount of money to be given to the bride by the groom's family is also
                decided. After this, the Maulavi asks the bride three times, whether she accepts
                the concerned person as her husband, with settled the amount of the Mehar.

                After her consent, the groom is asked three times, whether he accepts the concerned
                woman as his wife, with the decided amount of Mehar. After his consent, the Nikahnama
                is signed by the couple. </span>

                The Parsi wedding rituals begin with Rupia Peravanu ceremony. This is the unofficial
                engagement between both the families. Ladies from groom's family visit the bride's
                house and gift her silver coins and shagun. This ceremony is repeated at the groom's
                house as the bride's family visits them. After this, Madhavsaro is observed. According
                to this, the families of the bride and the groom plant a tree in a pot individually.
                This pot is kept at the entrance of the houses and watered everyday till the eighth
                day after marriage and then planted somewhere else.
                <br />
                This is followed by the ritual of Adarni, wherein the groom's family visits the
                bride's place and gives her gifts like clothing and jewelry. The guests are treated
                with sev and dahi, boiled eggs and bananas. Just a day before the wedding Supra
                nu Murat ritual is performed. This ritual is similar to the haldi ceremony organized
                in Hindus.
                <br />
                <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                For a Parsi wedding a stage is set in a baug or agiary, the Fire Temple. Here, before
                the groom steps on the stage, the bride's mother performs a ritual called Achumichu.
                She holds a tray containing a raw egg, supari, rice, coconut, dates and water. She
                circles all these items, except water, seven times around the groom's head and throws
                on the floor. The water is thrown on either side. This is repeated by the groom's
                mother for the bride. This is followed by Ara Antar, in which the bride and the
                groom are seated facing each other, with a cloth in between.
                <br />
                After this, the priest circles the couple with a string, seven times. On the seventh
                round the couple is supposed to throw rice at each other from over the curtain.
                Whoever does it first, is supposed to rule the household. Now, the couple sits besides
                each other with the seven strands of string binding them. Oil lamps are lighted
                on each side and the priest begins prayer ceremony.
                <br />

                    The important Sikh wedding rituals are given below.<br />
                    <b>Pre Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                    The first pre wedding ritual is the engagement or the Tilak ceremony. The bhaiji
                    or the preacher of the Gurudwara recites hymns, offers a date to the groom and applies
                    tilak on his forehead. After this ceremony gifts are exchanged between both the
                    families. The next is the Chura ceremony, which is held at the bride's place. Here,
                    the maternal uncle or aunt of the bride gives red and white bangles to her for wearing.
                    Silver and gold ornaments are tied to the bangles, called Kalirein. 'Maiya' is the
                    custom wherein the bride and the groom are not allowed to leave their house for
                    sometime before marriage.<br />
                    The next ritual is Gana, wherein a red thread is tied on the right wrist of the
                    groom and on the left wrist of the bride. This is considered to protect them from
                    ill omen. Just few days before marriage, Vatna ceremonyis performed, in which vatna
                    a scented powder made of barley flour, turmeric and mustard oil is applied to the
                    couple. This is followed by a ceremonial bath. On the eve of the wedding, Mehendi
                    ceremony is organized. In this, mehndi is applied on the hands and feet of the bride.
                    Gharoli is another pre wedding ritual, wherein the water from Gurdwara is fetched
                    in an earthen pot for the ritual bath of the groom.<br />
                    <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                    The wedding rituals are quite brief in Sikhs. On the main day, a flower veil is
                    tied to the groom's forehead, by his sisters. A currency garland also adorns his
                    neck. This is followed by Milni ceremony, in which both the families meet at the
                    bride's place. They then attend the Gurudwara kirtan where shabads are sung and
                    ardaas are recited. After this, the bride and the groom circle around the Guru Granth
                    Sahib and seek blessings.<br />
                    <b>Post Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                    After the wedding ceremony at the Gurudwara, the bride parts from her family. This
                    is what the Vidaai ceremony is all about. The bride's family bids her a tearful
                    farewell as she throws back handful rice over her shoulders. This is followed by
                    a reception party or grand feast organized by the groom's family. This is organized
                    in order to welcome the new member in the family and to formally introduce her to
                    family and friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                Gujarati wedding rituals.<br />
                <b>Pre Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                The pre wedding rituals begin Mangal Mahurat ceremony. It is performed by both the
                bride and the groom in their respective houses. Prayers are offered to Lord Ganesha
                to remove all obstacles. After matching the horoscopes of the couple, Griha Shanti
                puja is held. This is done by the priest at the houses of both the bride as well
                as the groom. The next ritual is known as 'Jaan' and it is performed to ward off
                any evil. It is quite interesting as the groom visits the bride place and touches
                his mother in law's feet to seek blessings. While he does so, she tries to clutch
                his nose and he tries to escape.
                <br />
                <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                On the wedding day, the first ritual, which takes place, is the Jaimala, wherein
                the couple exchanges garlands twice. Next is the Madhuparka ritual in which groom's
                feet are washed and he is given honey and milk to drink. During this the sisters
                of the bride try to steal the groom's shoes, known as 'Juta Churai'. One of the
                most important rituals on the wedding day is Kanyadaan, in which the bride's father
                washes groom's feet and gives him the hand of his daughter. This is followed by
                Hasta Milap, wherein the groom's shawl is tied with bride's saree.
                <br />
                The tying of the holy knot and the joined hands of the couple, signify their union.
                Rose petals and rice are showered upon them, during this time. After this, the couple
                takes rounds, around the scared fire, while the priest chants mantras. These are
                known as Mangalpheras. There are four pheras in Gujarati marriage. This is followed
                by Saptapadi, which are seven steps and vows taken by the couple together. Subsequently,
                they are blessed by their parents and elders.<br />
                <b>Post Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                Reception is post wedding ritual, wherein all the near and dear ones give gifts
                to the couple. This is followed by the Vidaai ceremony, in which the bride is bid
                a tearful farewell by her family. </span>

                <b>Pre Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                Lagana Lekhan is a small puja, held at the bride's house. Here, an auspicious date
                and time for the wedding is decided by the priest. It is then sent to the groom's
                house. The reading out of this letter by the priest, at the groom's house is known
                as Lagna Patrika Vachan. This takes place after the Vinayakyantra puja is done by
                the groom. The Sagai takes place at the groom's place, wherein a puja is conducted.
                The bride's brother applies tika on the groom's forehead and presents him with gifts
                like gold chain, clothes, sweets, token money etc.<br />
                <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                Phere are the most important ritual in the Jain wedding. The bride and the groom
                are seated in the mandap. The father of the bride performs Kanyadaan or Kanyavaran
                ritual. He places one rupee and twenty five paise and rice in her right hand and
                hands her to the bridegroom. While chanting mantras, the priest pours holy water
                on the hands of the couple thrice. This is followed by Granthi Bandhan, in which
                a married woman ties the knot between the bride's sari and groom's shawl.<br />
                After this the mangal pheras take place around the sacred fire. During the pheras
                mahaveerashtak strot is recited in the background while the ladies sing mangal geet.
                The couple also takes the seven vows after the pheras. After this, the bride is
                regarded as Vamangi, as she becomes the better of her husband. Next is the exchange
                of garlands between the couple. The havan finally concludes with Shantipath and
                Visarjan.
                <br />
                <b>Post Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                After the wedding rituals are over the elders come forward to bless the newly wed
                couple for the forth coming marital life. This is known as Ashirvada ceremony. On
                the arrival of the couple to the groom's house, the bride is given a warm welcome
                by her marital family.

                Sakhar Puda ceremony is the initial ritual which takes place in a Maharashtrain
                wedding. It can be termed as the engagement, wherein the bride is given a sari,
                and sweet or sugar, by the groom's family. Next is the Kelvan ceremony, which is
                performed at both the bride's and the groom's house. It is a small puja of the kuldevta,
                followed by a meal. After this, the Haldi ceremony takes place, wherein turmeric
                paste is applied to both the bride and the groom. This is known as Halad Chadavane.
                This is followed by Simant puja, wherein, once the groom arrives at the bride's
                place; her parents wash his feet and give him gifts.
                <br />
                <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                Antarpat is a silk shawl used to separate the bride and the groom. The maternal
                uncle of the bride brings her to the dias, where the mangalashtakas are recited.
                Then the shawl is removed and the couple sees each other for the first time and
                exchange garlands. At this moment they are showered with unbroken rice. After this,
                the couple asks their parents for permission to get married. This is called the
                Sankalp ceremony. After this, the bride's parents perform the Kanyadaan ritual,
                wherein they offer their daughter to the groom.
                <br />
                After Kanyadaan, the groom ties mangalsutra around bride's neck and applies vermillion
                in her hair parting. She in return applies a sandalwood tilak on his forehead. Next
                is the Vivah Homa, which is conducted by the groom in assistance with the priest.
                Following this is the Saptapadhi ritual, wherein the couple takes seven rounds around
                the sacred fire, taking seven vows. The wedding ceremony comes to an end with the
                Karmasampati ritual, wherein the bride's father, the bride and the groom please
                Gods to bless the wedlock.<br />
                <b>Post Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                Grihapravesh is the first ritual conducted after wedding. The groom's mother welcomes
                the new couple and washes their feet with milk and water. After this the traditional
                aarti is performed and the bride is asked to enter the house by knocking down a
                glass of rice, kept at the entrance. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;

            &nbsp; &nbsp; Indian people are stern believers of religion and ancient practices.
            As a result, Hindu&nbsp; marriages in India include a number of rituals and customs. These
            are age old practices, which form the foundation of our society and are therefore
            followed by generation over generation, owing to the deep faith. Wedding is undoubtedly
            the most important event in one's lifetime and is thus solemnized with utmost sanctity.
            Hindus believe that once married the couple is bound with each other for seven birth
            cycles. Such is the depth and intensity of their faith in the institution of marriage.
            This is attributed by the various rituals they observe.

                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The pre wedding rituals include Juran ceremony, Tel Diya custom,
                Pani Tola &amp; Nuani tradition. In Juran ceremony, the groom's mother visits the
                house of the bride. The bride's mother greets her and gives her xhorai, brass plate
                with a stem. In Tel Diya custom, the groom's mother puts a ring and betel on her
                daughter-in-law's hair parting.
                <br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Over this she pours oil thrice. After this, she applies her sindoor
                and gives the wedding trousseau. It includes mekhla chadar, the traditional Assamese
                dress for women. In Pani Tola tradition, the mothers of the bride and the groom
                gather holy water for the ceremonial bath of the bride. According to Nuani tradition,
                the bride is given a bath to prepare her for the wedding.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Wedding Rituals</b><br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; The wedding rituals begin with the ceremonial bath of the bride and
                the groom. For this their respective mothers visit the nearby river and collect
                holy water. After this the wadding reception takes place, wherein sumptuous food
                is served to the guests, with fish and meat as the highlights. This is followed
                by the procession of the groom. When he finally reaches the venue, the bride's family
                indulges in fun activities.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; The groom's procession is given entry into the bride's home only after
                they pay a heavy price. Subsequently, the bride's mother welcomes him while the
                bride's sister washes his feet. Next, the brother of the bride lifts him to take
                him to the wedding hall. The groom is usually dress in dhoti, kurta and silk shawl.
                The bride is given panch - amrit, before going to the hall. It is a mixture of ghee,
                curd, honey, sugar and raw milk.
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; This is followed by a remarkable entry of the bride on the shoulders
                of her maternal uncle. Here, the wedding ceremony takes place in front of the sacred
                fire. The couple exchange garlands and takes vows amidst chanting mantras. After
                this, conch shells are blown and the groom puts vermillion in bride's forehead.
                Friends and relatives then step forward to bless the newly wed couple. After the
                wedding ceremony is over the couple moves to groom's house where they are welcomed
                by the bridegroom's mother with traditional aarti.
